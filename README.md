## spring boot application scheduling

this application is a demo of dynamic schedule task uses just spring boot web starter

NOTE: 

DO NOT use this model in cluster application, 
cause it will make you task repeat in another service

you can use third-part store service to store your task, 
then consume those task separately when you start cluster services
